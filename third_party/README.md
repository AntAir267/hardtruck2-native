Third-party sources fetched and built locally (not committed):

- SDL3 (zlib licence), 3.4.18 or later: the official source release from
  github.com/libsdl-org/SDL, unpacked here as SDL3-<version>/ and installed into sdl3/ as a
  static library with its headers:

      cmake -S SDL3-3.4.18 -B SDL3-build -DSDL_SHARED=OFF -DSDL_STATIC=ON \
            -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="$PWD/sdl3"
      cmake --build SDL3-build -j8 && cmake --install SDL3-build

  (or point the Makefile at another copy: `make SDL3=/path/to/sdl3`).

For the player download (tools/release/linux.sh), also (the same pieces as 1NSANE: Recompiled's and TD6's, plus innoextract):

- Zig 0.17.0 (MIT licence): the official Linux x86_64 build from ziglang.org, unpacked as
  zig-x86_64-linux-0.17.0/. It builds the download, and the download carries it (without doc/)
  to compile the player's translation.
- SDL3 again, built with that Zig for glibc 2.31 into sdl3-rel/ (configure SDL3-<version> with
  CMAKE_C_COMPILER set to `zig cc -target x86_64-linux-gnu.2.31` and its ar and ranlib,
  CMAKE_C_FLAGS="-idirafter /usr/include -idirafter /usr/include/x86_64-linux-gnu",
  SDL_SHARED=OFF, SDL_STATIC=ON, SDL_X11_XSCRNSAVER=OFF, CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release).
- FFmpeg 8.0.1 (LGPL 2.1 or later): ffmpeg-8.0.1.tar.xz from ffmpeg.org (sha256
  05ee0b03119b45c0bdb4df654b96802e909e0a752f72e4fe3794f487229e5a41), unpacked as
  ffmpeg-8.0.1/ and built with that Zig into ffmpeg-rel/, only what Hard Truck 2 uses (the Indeo 5
  video and MP3 decoders, the MP3 demuxer and parser, swscale, swresample): configure in ffmpeg-build/ with
  --prefix=../ffmpeg-rel --cc, --ar and --ranlib the Zig ones, then the options the release
  script writes into the download's licenses/FFmpeg-BUILD.txt; then HAVE_SYSCTL 0 in config.h
  (glibc 2.31 has no sys/sysctl.h), make, make install. The download carries the tarball (the
  LGPL's source).
- python-standalone/: CPython 3.14 for any Linux with glibc 2.17 or later, from
  github.com/astral-sh/python-build-standalone (install_only_stripped), unpacked as python/: it
  runs the translator and the installer.
- pack-venv/: a Python virtual environment with Capstone 5.0.9 (manylinux), whose package the
  download puts beside that Python.
- appimagetool-x86_64.AppImage (github.com/AppImage/appimagetool) and appimage-runtime-x86_64,
  the runtime it puts at the front of an AppImage.
- innoextract/: innoextract 1.9 (zlib licence; Boost, bzip2, liblzma and libstdc++ inside it), the
  official static Linux build innoextract-1.9-linux.tar.xz from constexpr.org/innoextract (sha256
  008efe5011476ccc4aae17c3e22038b5a1bc5c7aad2b9d4d869537bf3874d21f), its binary at
  innoextract/innoextract and its licences in innoextract/license/. It unpacks the player's GOG
  installer without running it (tools/install.py); the download carries it.
